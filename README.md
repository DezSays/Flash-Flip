##What It Is

Flash-Flip is a game designed for students to better understand the core concepts of full-stack web development. This game includes 24 categories, and each category has five levels of difficulty. In order to begin playing, the user must select 6 categories and click the 'Start Game!' button. 

Once the game has started a score will appear. The score will update throughout the game until all of the questions have been answered.

This is an independent project built using primarily React and Redux.
